February 2025

This React application is an E-Commerce App that manages customers and products.
- Customers are greeted by a home page with a React Bootstrap Nav Bar.
- An Add Customer page allows the user to add a customer using their name, email, and phone.
- The Customers page lists all current customers with an option to delete.
- The Add Product page allows the user to add a product using the name and price of the product.
- The Products page lists all current products with options to edit or delete.

The application uses form validation, React Bootstrap, and error handling to increase ease of use.
